# Classification_of_modulation_using_deep_learning
AMC (automatic modulation categorization) is indeed a technique for determining a receiving signal's modulation. Current communication technologies, 
such as multiple input multiple output (MIMO), are used by IoT devices to receive the signal from various resources. Recognizing modulation is crucial. 
The latency requirement in IoT applications can be solved using content AMC methods mixed with deep learning techniques. 
An effective convolutional neural network has been proposed to categorise the modulation of received signals.
